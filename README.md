## JesNic Module

STATUS: This project is discontinued

This repository contains all files used for the development of a high level module using ESP8266 with Micropython.
It includes:
- documentation
- firmware (in this case Micropython for ESP8266)
- files and a specific library with some basic functions
- tools

Please, keep in mind you need to have some tools installed if you want to code ESP8266 using micropython, like:
- esptool
- any text editor or IDE (we recommend you use Thonny IDE or the normal Python IDLE)
- ampy (recommended if you do not have a way to code or manage the files on your board)
