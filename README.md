## JesNic Module (THIS IS DISCONTINUED, A BETTER VERSION USING C++ IS AVAILABLE!)

STATUS: This project is discontinued

This repository contains all files used for the development of a high level module using ESP8266 with Micropython.
It includes:
- documentation
- firmware (in this case Micropython for ESP8266)
- files and a specific library with some basic functions
- tools

Please, keep in mind you need to have some tools installed if you want to code ESP8266 using micropython, like:
- esptool
- any text editor or IDE (we recommend you use Thonny IDE)
- ampy (recommended if you do not have a way to manage the files on your board)

* Thonny IDE has some very useful built-in tools for managing your board, like uploading code, viewing files, etc.
